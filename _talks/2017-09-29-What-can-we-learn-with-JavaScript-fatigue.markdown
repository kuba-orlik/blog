This is a longer version of [the talk I have presented at NebraskaJS 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szliuFBcgX0).

In it, I not only explore our goals as software engineers, the UNIX philosophy and the history and causes of JavaScript, but I also create a parallel between psychology and decision making and JavaScript.

[This talk has also been the inspiration for one of the most read blog posts I've ever written, which you can find right here](/2017/07/17/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-JavaScript-Fatigue.html).

One of the interesting things in this conference is that two talks share the same stage and attendees can listen to the ones they want by switching the channels on their headphones, allowing us to have more speakers presenting in less time, which is really cool. This is also why I mention "their talk" sometimes.
