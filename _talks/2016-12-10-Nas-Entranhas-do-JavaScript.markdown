This talk has been presented at the end of 2016 in Porto Alegre, Brazil. I have also written [a blog post this trip in this blog](/2016/12/11/FrontInPoa-2016-Meta-Programming-And-Lots-of-New-Friends.html), which was great by the way!

In it I talk about the Meta Object Protocol to explain how JavaScript work behind the scenes and then we explore a few creative approach to solving problems by using meta-programming techniques.

The keynote presentation for this talk can be found at [this SpeakerDeck link](https://speakerdeck.com/lucasfcosta/nas-entranhas-do-javascript-meta-programacao#).

I'd also like to thank everyone at [@BrazilJS](https://braziljs.org/) for making this happen, it was great to be there and the whole event was awesome!
