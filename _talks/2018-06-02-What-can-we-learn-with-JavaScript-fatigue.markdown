This is a longer and updated version of [the talk I have presented at NebraskaJS 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szliuFBcgX0) and the one I presented at [The Conf SÃ£o Paulo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnlnF5PJYKA).

In it, I not only explore our goals as software engineers, the UNIX philosophy and the history and causes of JavaScript, but I also create a parallel between psychology and decision making and JavaScript.

[This talk has also been the inspiration for one of the most read blog posts I've ever written, which you can find right here](/2017/07/17/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-JavaScript-Fatigue.html).
