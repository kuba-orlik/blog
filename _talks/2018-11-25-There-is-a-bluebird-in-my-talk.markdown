**This is one of my favourite talks ever**. This talk is a longer version of [the talk I have presented at JSConf Colombia](/talks/2018-11-17-There-is-a-bluebird-in-my-talk.html) a week before.

In it, I show people how we can use only functions to write any program that has ever been written or that will ever be written. Yes, that's precisely it â€” no conditionals, no strings, no numbers, no bit manipulation. Nothing but pure functions.

As I've explained in the talk, [such an endeavour](https://github.com/tomstuart/nothing) has been presented before. However, what I wanted with this talk is to take it one step further: do everything in small digestible steps in JavaScript and then explain what combinators are and how we can use them to replace all of the functions we've written. In the end, I go even further and show that you can also replace all code with only two combinators.

**If you want to go straight to the live-coding part you can skip to 8:20.**
