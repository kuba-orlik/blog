This is the first time I've presented this talk. It's inspired in my most popular blog post ever: "[_How I'm still not using GUIs: A guide to the terminal_](https://lucasfcosta.com/2019/02/10/terminal-guide-2019.html)".

In it, I talk a bit about the benefits of using CLI tools, the CLI tools I use, and *how* I use them.
