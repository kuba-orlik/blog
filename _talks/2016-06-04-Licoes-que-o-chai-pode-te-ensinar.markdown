This is my first talk ever and it has been presented at my city's JavaScript meetup. I have learned a lot and improved my talking skills after this talk. I also and made some very nice friends who I hang out with nowadays.

In this talk I explain a little bit about how I got involved with the Chai project and Open Source in general and I talk about how to create an open, active and inclusive community.

I also talk about some of the tools we use and how does our work proccess is handled.

The video quality may not be so good because the only recording we have got is the one that was taken from the livestream, but I think it won't be a problem for native portuguese speakers to understand it.

Open Software is great software! Feel free to use the comments area to share your thoughts.
