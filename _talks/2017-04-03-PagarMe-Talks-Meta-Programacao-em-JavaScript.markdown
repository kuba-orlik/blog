I've been to SÃ£o Paulo in order to get my US visa so I can talk at [FluentConf](https://conferences.oreilly.com/fluent/fl-ca) in California in June and while I was there my friend [@marquinhoalm](https://twitter.com/marquinhoalm) invited me to visit [Pagar.me](https://pagar.me/) and deliver a lightning talk.

It was great to make lots of new friends in a new city and their awesome office. I can't wait to go back to SÃ£o Paulo!

I'd like to thank everyone at PagarMe for this incredible opportunity and for the politeness, good conversation and cups of coffee we've had.

You rock!
