This is my second talk ever and it has been presented at my city's JavaScript meetup. There were about 70 people there and it was really awesome!

If you want to learn more about Meta Programming and have some fun with brazilian memes and healthy jokes about Java (I actually know how to write it and have already worked it).

Be ready to learn about the internals of the language and explore new possibilities.

The video quality may not be so good because the only recording we have got is the one that was taken from the livestream, but I think it won't be a problem for native portuguese speakers to understand it.

Also, if you're not from Brazil you probably won't understand those gifs of amateur bodybuilders because they're part of a very popular Brazilian meme video. Just so you know why they're there.

I hope you like it!
