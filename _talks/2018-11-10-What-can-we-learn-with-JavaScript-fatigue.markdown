This talk has been presented in Munich, Germany, at DACHFest 2019.

It follows pretty much the same format and covers the same content as the other editions, especially since this one was a bit shorter than usual.

[This talk has also been the inspiration for one of the most read blog posts I've ever written, which you can find right here](/2017/07/17/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-JavaScript-Fatigue.html).
