Iâ€™m a Brazilian software engineer living in London.

I write JavaScript most of the time, and Iâ€™m passionate about open-source. For the past few years, I have been a maintainer of [Chai.js](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/). Iâ€™m very active on [GitHub](https://github.com/lucasfcosta) and have contributed to numerous projects, including [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) and [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io/).

As an author, Iâ€™ve written [_Testing JavaScript Applications_](https://www.manning.com/books/testing-javascript-applications), a book published by [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/).

I like opinionated books, beautiful code, well-engineered prose, command-line interfaces, and vim. In fact, I like vim so much that [I got a `:w` tattoed on my ankle](/assets/vimtattoo.jpg).

Content that I _own_ is always up for grabs. Universities and online courses use some of these posts as reference material, and you can do the same if you want.

I have been voluntarily translated into many languages, including Russian, Mandarin, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. If you wish to translate any of these posts, you *donâ€™t* need to ask for permission.

Everything I produce belongs to the internet. It has made me who I am, and, therefore, it deserves all I have.
