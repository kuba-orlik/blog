I'm a Brazilian software engineer living in London. I was born in the land of carnival but my heart is in the land where people put milk in their tea.

I write JavaScript most of the time and I'm passionate about open-source. For the past few years, I have been a maintainer of [Chai.js](http://chaijs.com/) and [Sinon.js](http://sinonjs.org/).

I like opinionated books, beautiful code, well-engineered prose, command-line interfaces and vIM. In fact, I like vIM so much that [I got a `:w` tattoed on my ankle](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DY65vJAW0AEfF-h.jpg).

By the way, I dislike bios in the third person, there's has no warmth in them. An "I" makes them intimate.
