In this post, I'll present a robust and disruptive Agile framework. It's called "talk to your customers". Soon I'll be selling a 500-page book with enough diagrams to convince you it's a framework worth trying. If you or your company are interested, you can also contact me for a $50,000 workshop in which I'll recite platitudes and show you all the technical terms I've coined to illustrate this complex approach. For now, bear with me. This blog post is all I've got.

The Talk To Your Customers framework â€” or TTYC, in short â€” revolves around talking to your customers, an arcane methodology long forgotten in the software industry. Here's a flow chart to help you understand the core concepts of the TTYC framework.

The TTYC framework has two roles: the customer and the product developer. The customer is responsible for having problems, and the product developer is responsible for delivering solutions to these problems. In exchange for the solution, the customer will provide the product developer with an artefact called money.

Different from other Agile frameworks, TTYC focuses on this "money" artefact instead of story points, cycle-time, and velocity. My experience in the software industry tells me that many may see this abrupt focus shift as a disadvantage, and I understand such a complex metric may turn some folks off. Yet, I firmly believe in this item called "money".

For the folks who like graphs, here's what an ideal plot of money over time must look like.

See? It's all very scientific. As time passes, money should go up, not down. The higher it goes, and the more quickly it goes up, the better.

Now that you've seen a high-level overview of the TTYC landscape, and understood its core metric, let's talk about how to put TTYC into practice.

In _Talk To Your Customers_, the first thing you should do is talk to your customers. You should get them on a call, or meet them for coffee, and listen to their problems. I know it may sound counter-intuitive, but for this technique to work, you'll have to actually _listen_. If they allow you to, you can also record them so that you can listen as many times as you need.

If you've got a recording, you should also incentivize other team members to listen to it. Yes, that includes the people writing the software. Remember: there's no "software developer" role in TTYC. There's only the customer and the product developer.

Here's why the listening step is crucial: remember what I mentioned about that "money over time metric"? Customers are the ones giving you the money, and it _seems_ they're more likely to give it to you if the solutions you deliver actually solve their problems. Now, the only way to solve the customer's problems is to listen to them.

Once you've listened to the customer's problems comes the most challenging part of TTYC: solving them.

At this stage, TTYC recommends your team think about what the customer wants to accomplish and why. If any questions arise during the process, you should go back to the first step: talking to your customer. Just remember: it's _your_ job to come up with the solution, and it's the customer's job to have a problem, not the other way round. Therefore, when you go back to them to ask questions, ensure you're not simply asking them to design the solution for you. If they could do that, they'd probably have done it already â€” also, if they could have done that but didn't, it's because the problem doesn't matter that much, so you need to pay attention to that too.

Once you've got a grasp of what the solution might be, you should go and build it. There are only two caveats you need to which you need to pay attention here. The first is that you don't necessarily need to get the solution right straight away, and the second is that building it doesn't necessarily mean writing the code.

Let me explain those two caveats in more detail.

<br>

## Getting the solution right

As contradictory as it may seem, TTYC's core value is talking to customers, which means you can rely on them to tell you whether the proposed solution works.

Over my many years of religiously executing TTYC, I've noticed that, for some reason, it's usually better to ask the customer whether your solution works than to confabulate among developers in two-hour-long meetings. It may be because the customer is the one driving the "money" metric, but I'm not sure.

That means instead of trying to get the solution right straight away, it's better to try something likely to work in as little time as possible and ship it. If it doesn't work, customers will let you know, providing you listen to them. If you follow this approach, you'll shorten the "time" metric (remember our "money vs time" graph).

## Building it

Customers will only provide the "money" artefact if you solve their problems. Notice I didn't mention "using Kubernetes" or "microservices" anywhere in that phrase. Do you know why? It's because it doesn't matter. I didn't mention code too. And that's because it doesn't matter either.

If you develop a no-code prototype in an hour and your customer tells you it solves their problem and they're willing to give you money for it, that's great. You've achieved the goal of increasing the "money" metric and diminishing the "time" it takes to get it.

From here on, you can now decide between scaling your solution, improving it, or finding other problems to solve.

To summarise: in TTYC, we advocate that building software which solves the customer's problems is better than building complex software. It may seem absurd, but problem-solving and money are highly correlated â€” much more highly correlated than money and Kubernetes.

## Putting it all together

The TTYC framework focuses on a disruptive concept called "talk to your customers". Although the framework's name has "talk" in it, it really means "listening".

This framework has two roles: the product developer and the customer. The product developer's goal is to acquire an artefact called "money" and to do so in as little time as possible. The customer's role is to solve their problem. If the product developer can offer a solution to the customer, the customer will exchange their "money" artefacts for the solution.

The revolutionary aspect of TTYC is acknowledging that solving the customer's problems is more important than building software or having meetings. Therefore, it advocates that product developers must talk to customers instead of confabulating possible solutions and that they must ship their solution to see if it works instead of assuming it does.
